This is my personal project, for the year of 2021. 

Here, there is the code for the app I made, to use it, you have to download a few things first.

1: Python 3.9

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/ and download it.

2: Tensorflow and Tensorflow Datasets

Go to command line (cmd) and type in 
py -m pip install Tensorflow
and
py -m pip install tensorflow-datasets

3: Install OpenCv2 

Go to cmd like in step 2, type in
py -m pip install opencv-python


After this, go to the ai.py file, and open it with Python 3.9.

To use, draw a letter in the Square, click "Analyse" to see what it predicts it is, and click Erase to erase the current letter.
